## Preamble

### Background

This version of Spectre CSS has been forked from the [original repo](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) owned by [@picturepan](https://github.com/picturepan2), who did incredible work to bring this CSS framework to the web.

Unfortunately, work seems to have stopped on the codebase, with PRs dating back 5 or 6 years, and no communication from the author.

### Aims

Without hard-feeling, this new fork has been created under a new organisation [spectre-org](https://github.com/spectre-org/) with the intention of:

- keeping the project alive
- merging outstanding pull requests
- publishing new releases
- potentially making future updates (such as [Spectre Vue](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-vue))

A discussion about these aims has been started [here](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css/discussions/2), and you are encouraged to contribute!

Please see the checklist there and [issues](https://github.com/spectre-org/spectre-css/issues) to keep up to date with progress.

### Name changes

To avoid confusion, note:

- The original framework name Spectre.css, is now just Spectre CSS
- The original NPM package name `spectre.css` (with a dot) is now `spectre-css` (with a dash)
